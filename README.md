# AI Requirement Validator  

AI Requirement Validator is an intelligent tool that extracts and generates structured project requirements from document uploads. Supporting various file formats such as **Word (.docx), PDF, and PowerPoint (.pptx)**, the system automatically identifies **functional and non-functional requirements** and allows users to save them in **Word or Excel** format for easy documentation.  

## ‚ú® Features  

### üìÇ Document Upload & Extraction  
- **Supported Formats**: Word (.docx), PDF, and PowerPoint (.pptx).  
- **Automated Parsing**: Extracts key details from uploaded documents to generate precise project requirements.

### üìå Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements  
- **Functional Requirements** define the **core features and behaviors** of a system. They specify **what** the system should do, including user interactions, data processing, and business logic. Examples include **user authentication, payment processing, and search functionality**.  

- **Non-Functional Requirements** focus on the **quality attributes** of the system, specifying **how** it should perform rather than what it does. These include **performance, security, scalability, reliability, and usability**. For example, a system should handle **1,000 concurrent users**, ensure **data encryption using AES-256**, or **load within 2 seconds**.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements Generation  
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Automatically distinguishes between functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **Structured Output**: Ensures clarity and completeness in requirement documentation.  

### üìÑ Export & Save Options  
- **Download as Word or Excel**: Save the extracted requirements in user-friendly formats for further use.
